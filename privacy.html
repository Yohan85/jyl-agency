<h2>1. Field of application</h2>

Likewise, third-party services to which the service may refer by so-called links are excluded from the field of application.JYL Studios is not responsible for their content or compliance with any data protection regulations. This includes, for example, links to social networks such as LinkedIn and Xing.

This also applies to the personal data that the user communicates to us via such a platform, for example by contacting our user profile in the respective social network. Information on the use and protection of the user's personal data on these platforms can be found in the privacy policy of the respective platform.

These companies are listed in the so-called "Privacy Shield List" or "Privacy Shield List". Facebook is one of the companies listed there. The transmission to Facebook in connection with Facebook-Connect is based on Art. 45 GDPR.

<h2>4. Data processing in connection with ad-financed services</h2>
Individual offers (such as individual games or other individual services) may be wholly or partly financed by advertising. In the case of services financed by advertising, advertising is displayed instead of payment to be paid by the user for the provision and use of the service to the user during the use of the service in order to finance the provision of the service. For the insertion of advertising, data for the identification of the user's device (IP address, individual device ID of the device or identifier), which is used to use the offer, is processed.

When the user accesses content included in this service which contains such a social plugin from Facebook, the user's terminal device creates a direct connection to Facebook's servers, which may also be located in the USA. Facebook directly transmits the content of the social plugin to the user's browser, which then integrates it into the website of this service.

If the user interacts with the social plugins, for example by clicking the "Like" button or making a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted directly from the user's device to Facebook and stored there. If the user is not a member of Facebook, it is still possible that Facebook stores the IP address of the user's device, but according to Facebook, only an anonymized IP address is stored in France. If the user is a member of Facebook and does not want Facebook to collect data about him or her via this service and link it to the user data stored on Facebook, the user must log out of Facebook before using the service. For further information on the purpose and extent of data collection and the further use of the data by Facebook, as well as your rights and options to protect your privacy, please refer to the Facebook's own privacy policy under the following link: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. JYL Studios points out that the user can block social plugins for his browser with the help of browser add-ons.
